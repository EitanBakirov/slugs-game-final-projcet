# slugs-game-final-project
Game development final project in Software Engineering College

## Description

In this project I implemented my OOP, C# and game development knowledge that I got to learn during the thirteenth grade of Software Engineering at Hakfar Hayarok College.
This is a 2D game ran using Monogame (open-source and cross-platform game development framework) and XNA framework integrated within it. 
"Slugs" is a turn-based artillery strategy game where players control teams of comical, heavily armed worms. 
In a destructible 2D environment, the objective is to eliminate opponents using an array of bizarre weapons and tactics, making it a humorous and engaging multiplayer experience.
